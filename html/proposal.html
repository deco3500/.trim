						<strong>Idea</strong>
						<p style="font-size:20px;color:#FFFFFF;">
						DiscoverLocal will be a mobile application, originally designed for android systems with the
						possibility for expansion to other mobile systems. It will use location data to “collect” stories as
						you travel around and it will present a list of stories to read about the places you visited or
						passed. You can set preferences to only collect certain types of stories or look for particular
						keywords/topics and users can submit external stories and pin them to a location for other users
						to discover or they can create their own stories and pin them to a location. Stories and users
						gain reputation if other users commend them and this reputation can be used as a filter also.
						Stories can be reported if they are not about that location or in the case of user created stories if
						they are not news stories or articles with local relevance. The app can push notifications about
						certain types of news stories, especially ones that are “happening now” events like “free live
						music”.</p>
						<p style="font-size:20px;color:#FFFFFF;">
						We believe this is a unique way to obtain local stories, regularly buried by the international or
						national headlines that in reality often have little impact on our everyday lives. It keeps locals
						“in-the-know” about events near them and spikes local interest in the suburbs they live, work,
						study and socialise in.</p>
						<strong>Target Audience</strong>
						<p style="font-size:20px;color:#FFFFFF;">
						Our target audience isn’t necessarily restricted by age, rather restricted by their interests and
						method of obtaining their news. Naturally being a mobile app, our users will be the users who
						generally get their news online from their phones and this will tend to attract younger audiences.
						Due to the nature of the application it will also tend to focus on users who have autonomy as
						you need to walk around in order to collect the news stories, combined with the previous point
						this means we will be targeting mainly university ages and up. In general, we will be targeting
						demographics who do not use much if any traditional news sources. Our audience will also be
						restricted mostly to more heavily populated areas initially as it is primarily user driven and users
						will produce content about the area they are in, though expanding into less populous areas
						would be a subject for research.</p>
