##Concept
* DiscoverLocal
* Android app
* Uses location data to “collect” stories as you walk
* Can set preferences to only collect certain types of stories
* Users can submit external stories (not about that website) and pin them to a location
* Users can create their own stories and pin them to a location
* Stories and users gain reputation if other users commend them this reputation can be used as a filter
* Stories can be reported if they are not about that location or in the case of user created stories if they are not news stories or  articles with local relevance
* Can get push notifications about certain types of news stories, especially ones that are “happening now” events like “free live     music”

##Communication
###Meetings and Gatherings

* Our main communication channel will be through Facebook.
* We will attend our studio workshop classes each week to communicate our progress and synchronise our ideas.
* Scheduled meetings if necessary.

###Task Division
* Members should nominate members for tasks based on each member’s strengths and weaknesses, and not just on personal preference.
* If a member is struggling with a task, they should inform the team as soon as possible so that other members can help, or the task    can be re-allocated.
* Progress of tasks should be updated each meeting, and is expected that some progress should be made each week, even if it is very little.
* Major tasks should have an attempted deadline of 48 hours before it is actually due. The deadline of sub-tasks will be determined by team discussion and will vary depending on the task.

##Plan
* Using Android Studio to write an APK (java skills). Start learn from that and practise
* The news data decide to getting from EBSCOhost News API or other story site
* We will be accessing the user’s location by using GPS(Maybe connect with GOOGLE API to get the location)
*	The social interaction will be focus on users can share their story and post on the   			 application. Their location will be tracked and share to other users.
