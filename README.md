#.trim(); Team Proposal

##Introduction
News queues these days are sorted by international popularity and therefore many local stories are buried and missed by the people who would take a genuine interest in their neighbourhood. This is the dilemma that our team has decided to tackle.

###We are .trim();

Our project is <b>DiscoverLocal</b>. DiscoverLocal will help users discover stories that are relevant to them and alert them to the happenings in their local area, their neighbourhood, and the places they regularly visit so they don’t find themselves living under a rock in their own home.

##Concept

###Idea
<b>DiscoverLocal</b> will be a mobile application, originally designed for android systems with the possibility for expansion to other mobile systems. It will use location data to “collect” stories as you travel around and it will present a list of stories to read about the places you visited or passed. You can set preferences to only collect certain types of stories or look for particular keywords/topics and users can submit external stories and pin them to a location for other users to discover or they can create their own stories and pin them to a location. Stories and users gain reputation if other users commend them and this reputation can be used as a filter also. Stories can be reported if they are not about that location or in the case of user created stories if they are not news stories or articles with local relevance. The app can push notifications about certain types of news stories, especially ones that are “happening now” events like “free live music”.

We believe this is a unique way to obtain local stories, regularly buried by the international or national headlines that in reality often have little impact on our everyday lives. It keeps locals “in-the-know” about events near them and spikes local interest in the suburbs they live, work, study and socialise in.

###Target Audience
Our target audience isn’t necessarily restricted by age, rather restricted by their interests and method of obtaining their news. Naturally being a mobile app, our users will be the users who generally get their news online from their phones and this will tend to attract younger audiences. Due to the nature of the application it will also tend to focus on users who have autonomy as you need to walk around in order to collect the news stories, combined with the previous point this means we will be targeting mainly university ages and up. In general, we will be targeting demographics who do not use much if any traditional news sources. Our audience will also be restricted mostly to more heavily populated areas initially as it is primarily user driven and users will produce content about the area they are in, though expanding into less populous areas would be a subject for research.

##Team
###Team and Roles
|Student|Number|Course Code|Primary Role|
|-------|------|-----------|------------|
|Rhys McCane|43235425|DECO3500|Team Leader|
|Mark Timmins|43220739|DECO3500|Back-end developer|
|Ian Wong|43526271|DECO3500|UI designer|
|Tavis Wong|43719046|DECO3500|Database Manager|

###Team Leader
<b>Rhys McCane</b> is the original project creator and will be the leader <b>.trim();</b>. He will coordinate the team when needed and moderate team meetings where necessary.

###Responsibilities
It is <b>EVERYONE</b>’s responsibility to arrive on time to meetings and presentations or provide plenty of notice to the team as well as the course staff with reasons for absence.

Meetings and gatherings will be arranged <b>AS A TEAM</b> based on team availability and we will expect there will be cooperation in finding a time that suits everyone. Meeting and gatherings are not restricted to university, nor face-to-face confrontations if other forms of meetings are required (for example online communication services like Skype).

Work will also be distributed evenly based on team members strengths and current work loads. These roles will be finalised by the group leader (Rhys McCane) and the expectation is that this will be completed by the agreed time or there is notice and valid reason that these tasked cannot be performed in time. 

###Making Decisions
Where a large decision involving the future and production of our project is involved, there will be a group discussion <b>with the team leader present</b> followed by a vote with majority rules. In the case of an even vote, the team leader will decide on the course of action.

###Performance and Conflict Management
The team will attempt to resolve any conflict or lack of performance with a private meeting with both the accused and team leader present. If the team leader is the accused, the whole team needs to be there for a sensible discussion and method for resolution. Any following conflict will not be accepted and poor behaviour will result in a conversation with course staff for guidance.

##Communication
Every week on Friday, the team will be meeting in the workshop to discuss about the progress of the project and scheduled meetings will be appointed if necessary.

Facebook will be the main communication channel between the members of the team as this platform are familiar and frequently used by all members so all members. A Facebook group has been created to post any enquires, problems and helps keep all the coursework together. Facebook also allows us to create a group chat for the Facebook group so that we can quickly communicate with each other remotely.

All the written documents will be stored within a Google Drive folder for easy shared access and Google Docs will be used for all members to contribute. 

Github will be used for keeping track of outstanding issues and for hosting any code related to the project.

##Plan
###Phases

* 02 September, Week 6: Research
* 09 September, Week 7: Requirements
* 16 September, Week 8: Design
* 07 October, Week 10: Building
* 21 October, Week 12: Evaluating

Though these will be the broad stages, we will take an iterative approach. That is we will regularly evaluate the product and that may lead us to redesign a particular part of the product. This way we will be able to adapt better to the challenges presented during the course of the project.

###Key Deliverables
* Research
  * Project Proposal
* Requirements
  * Requirements specification
  * Feature list ordered by value added to project
* Design
  * Paper Prototypes
  * Mock Ups
  * User Testing and Reports
* Build
  * Feature Prototypes (prototyping the main features)
  * Design Prototype (Working prototype that combines the feature prototypes into one app)
* Evaluation
  * Review of Design Prototype
  * Iteration of Prototype features if possible (improve the main flaws found before due date 28th of October)
  * Project and Context Reflection
  
###Resources
* Android Studio to write an APK
* EBSCOhost News API or other story site to get news data automatically
* We will be accessing the user’s location through the phones GPS(Maybe connect with GOOGLE API to get the location)
